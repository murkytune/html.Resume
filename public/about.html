<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born and raised in Illinois, USA. Currently living in Tampa, FL, USA. My father worked over 30 years in the the 
telephone company as a technician. He had a background in electronics and had lots of components in the workshop.
Therefore, I also became very interested in electronics and technology. My first computer was a Commodore Vic-20 
and later got a Commodore Plus/4. I took electronics all through high school and received a scholorship to further
my education in college. I received an associates degree in Applied Science, Electronics Technology. I was 
introduced to Windows-based PCs in college (they were very expensive!) I also had exposure to Macintosh computers.
After that portion of college I worked in technology both involving hardware and software.</p>

<p>In my free time I took an interest in building PCs. Additionally, I also delved into non-linear video editing.
At this time, the PCs required a special capture card to turn the video into digital format. All the equipment 
was expensive. Also, the computers were very slow compared to today's standards. Overall, the form was in its infancy.
I had returned to University where I had access to some higher end computers that hosted expensive non-linear editing 
suites. Very little time was available on these systems. Now, our mobile devices are more powerful than those elite
editing suites. From those times we've gone from Windows 3.0 to Windows 11, Macintosh computers are now Macs, and the 
preferred overall device for computing is a mobile phone device. The internet went from message boards to the 
vast cyberweb we know and love.</p>

<p>Even though I've watched computers as a tool for everyday people spring into existance and evolve over the years,
I'm still in awe of the technology. I still find it amazing how far technology has come and how fast it's still moving. 
As we watch AI move at lightning speed, the sense of wonder of what's to come fills my mind, but not without taking 
time to enjoy what we have. It's very much like looking at all the the electronic components and parts my father had 
laying when I was young. I'm happy to have the opportunity to be a part of this amazing collective network of digital 
progress.</p>
